# Detection Of Penumonia and Tuborculosis from Chest X-rays
Final year project Implementation in Python on Google Colaboratoy Detection of Pneumonia and tuberculosis is done using Convolutional Neural Networks The dataset is provided by following Medical and Data science promoting Organizations

1. NIH
2. Shenzhen China Hospital
3. Montgomery Hospital
4. Kaggle The data distribution is following Normal=1989 Pneumonia=4789 Tuberculosis=394
5. Data is highly imbalance and due to low number of samples i used shuffling and splitting to train it better The Keras Evaluated Accuracy is 93.2%
